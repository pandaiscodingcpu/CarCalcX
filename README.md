# CarCalcX
A linear regression model created using Sklearn, pandas and numpy to predict the car prize using parameters such as Brand, Fuel type, age etc.


# Libraries used and Workflow  

pandas: For data analysis , used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taeefnajib/used-car-price-prediction-dataset from kaggle  
Scikit-Learn: To train a linear regression model  
Numpy: To use log transformation on large price values in the dataset  
Streamlit: Built a user-friendly GUI with AI and used streamlit community platform to host  
Joblib: To save the model  

# Additional changes  
Used feature engineering to reduce RMSE,MSE,R(square) on the model  
ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation AFTER Feature Engineering:  

MAE  : 0.32  

MSE  : 0.19  

RMSE : 0.44  

RÂ² Score : 0.7306
